# models
I have collected a selection of models etc I have done.

One of the first ERDs I draw. It's a model to describe how a basic taxi service application could hold their information. It can be found in "Taxi_erd.png" file.

The second example file is from my side-project but as there is still hope that it could one day become something I have covered up some of the entities.
