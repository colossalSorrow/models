# models
I have collected a selection of models etc I have done.

One of the first ERDs I draw. It's a model to describe how a basic taxi service application could hold their information. It can be found in "Taxi_erd.png" file.

The second example file is from my side-project but as there is still hope that it could one day become something I have covered up some of the entities. This is in the "application_erd.png" file.

As I like all things models and visuals, I also added a file "process_flow-visual_fix.png". As I mention in my description messy and unclear visuals are something that I could lose sleep over. This is an example how I took a process flow irrelevant to me and just played around with the placement of the elements. I have removed all text from the process it's currently not important. But all the sizes and pool leghts/widths with the text in them have stayed the same on the original. Hopefully younotice which is original and which is the reworked one.
